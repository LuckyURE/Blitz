# Blitz
##What is it?
This extension puts all pull requests across all repositories into a queue. This allows users to review open pull requests and click the link to go to work the pull request. [Check it out on the VSTS marketplace!](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sierpinski.blitz-allpulls-extension)

##Details
This is for VSTS (VSO, TFS 2015). This extension shows all of the open pull requests in a project. The approver can then follow a link to work the pull request.

##Features In Latest Update
New features:
* Filter to only pull requests to which you have been assigned as a reviewer.
* Hover over Reviewer for more information on their vote.
* Rows now styled to show whether the pull request merged successfully with master.
* Repository name added.

##Why did I make it?
Our state's mail server went down and pull requests fell through the cracks. We also had some pull requests which dropped off the radar before they were completed. I just wanted a solution to see all of the pull requests across hundreds of repo.'s. So, I made one!

##Source Code and Issue Reporting
I've added the source to [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/sierpinski/Blitz). Please open issues with the extension there so I can track them more easily.

##Feature Ideas
Dive into code policies and more detailed statuses for each pull request.
