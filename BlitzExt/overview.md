# Blitz
##What is it?
This extension puts all pull requests across all repositories into a queue. This allows users to review open pull requests and click the link to go to work the pull request.

##Details
This is for VSTS (VSO, TFS 2015). This extension shows all of the open pull requests in a project. The approver can then follow a link to work the pull request.

Here is a big list of pull requests I just submitted:

##Why did I make it?
Our state's mail server went down and pull requests fell through the cracks. We also had some pull requests which dropped off the radar before they were completed. I just wanted a solution to see all of the pull requests across hundreds of repo.'s. So, I made one!

##Source/Known Issues
I've added the source to [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/sierpinski/Blitz). Please open issues with the extension there so I can track them more easily.

##Feature Ideas
Handling clicks on user links. Managing more than active requests. Handling less binary/diverse types of pull request statuses and merge statuses.
